### Self-build-Configuration-Center

In Baidu, we used the config-center to manage the the properties in the project. Some of the config-center are open-sourced, like the [Disconf](https://github.com/knightliao/disconf). However, sometimes, we do not want to use such a heavy solution, or we cannot fully trust the security of the others' codes, thus, we have to build the config-center by ourselves.<br>
The codes show a sample solution of how to build your own configuration center.
